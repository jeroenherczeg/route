# JSON Strategy

The JSON strategy aims to make building RESTful APIs a little easier. It is passed a PSR-7 `ServerRequestInterface` implementation and any route arguments and expects the controller to return either a PSR-7 `ResponseInterface` implementation or data in a format that can be converted to JSON.

~~~php
<?php

use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

$router = new League\Route\RouteCollection;

$router->setStrategy(new League\Route\Strategy\JsonStrategy);

// this route would be considered a "get all" resource
$router->get('/acme', function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
    // pull data from $request and do something clever

    return [
        // ... data to be converted to json
    ];
});

// this route would be considered a "get one" resource
$router->get('/acme/{id}', function (ServerRequestInterface $request, array $args) {
    // get any required data from $request and find entity relating to $args['id']

    return [
        // ... data to be converted to json
    ];
});
~~~

The problem with returning an array is that you are always assuming a `200 OK` HTTP response code, most PSR-7 implementations are likely to provide some convenience `ResponseInterface` implementations that will allow you to easily build a JSON response.

## HTTP 4xx Exceptions

In a RESTful API, covering all outcomes and returning the correct 4xx response can become quite verbose. Therefore, the dispatcher provides a convenient way to ensure you can return the correct response without the need for a conditional being created for every outcome.

Simply throw one of the HTTP exceptions from within your application layer and the dispatcher will catch the exception and build the appropriate response.

~~~php
<?php

use League\Route\Http\Exception\BadRequestException;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

$router->post('/acme', function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
    // create a record from the $request body

    // if we fail to insert due to a bad request
    throw new BadRequestException;

    // ...
});
~~~

If the exception is thrown, a request with the correct response code and headers is built containing the following body.

~~~json
{
    "status_code": 400,
    "message": "Bad Request"
}
~~~
